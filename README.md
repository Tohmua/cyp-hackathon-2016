# CYP Hackathon

## Feature
* Ability to add future events
* Don't notify before events
* Ask if you go to cancel
  * Thought provoking question
  * Different questions each time
  * "Dont want to talk about it" option
* After event push notification
  * "You didn't cancel this event, if you attended how did this make you feel?"

## Future Notifications(?)
* Time difference between cancelled time and event time. If it decreases this gets better.
* Danger Zones - if person ventures near a suicide hotspot for example maybe they get a call from a support line?
* Panic Button - defaults to 999 has quick option selects for things like Samaritans or custom number for a therapist?
